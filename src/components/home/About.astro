          Born in Argentina in 1989 and resident in Japan since 2017, I am a certified translator
          with over ten years of experience and top quality ratings. My main language pairs are
          Japanese/English/Italian into Spanish. Drawing from a broad international background, I
          collaborate with Japanese and global organizations on translation, localization,
          subtitling, dubbing and editing projects. With a passion for international communication,
          I strive to facilitate interactions and promote growth in a variety of markets. <br /><br
          />I specialize in business and digital media, but I am also active in other fields
          including marketing, tourism, music, education and international cooperation. I use CAT
          tools such as Trados Studio, Phrase or memoQ, among others, for cost-effective terminology
          management and quality assurance. Always in line with the latest trends in the translation
          industry, my goal is to deliver high-quality content that not only meets clientsâ€™ needs
          but also provides impactful, satisfying experiences.
