          Born in Argentina in 1989 and resident in Japan since 2017, I am a certified translator
          with over ten years of experience and top quality ratings. My main language pairs are
          Japanese, English and Italian into Spanish. Drawing from a broad international background,
          I collaborate with Japanese and global organizations on translation, localization,
          subtitling, dubbing and editing projects. With a passion for international communication,
          I strive to facilitate interactions and promote growth in a variety of markets. <br /><br
          />I specialize in business and digital media, but I am also active in other fields
          including marketing, tourism, music, education and international cooperation. I use CAT
          tools such as Trados Studio, Phrase or memoQ for cost-effective terminology management and
          quality assurance. Always in line with the latest trends in the translation industry, my
          goal is to deliver high-quality content that not only meets clientsâ€™ needs but also
          provides impactful, satisfying experiences.
