          Born in Argentina in 1989 and resident in Japan since 2017, I am a certified translator
          with over a decade of experience and top quality ratings. Drawing from a broad
          international background, I collaborate with Japanese and global organizations on
          translation and localization projects, facilitating interactions and growth in a variety of markets. <br /><br
          />I specialize in business and digital media, but I am also active in other fields
          including tourism, marketing, education, and international cooperation. I use tools such as Trados Studio and Phrase for optimal terminology management and quality assurance, delivering texts that
          not only meet clientsâ€™ needs but also provide impactful experiences.
