          Born in Argentina in 1989 and resident in Japan since 2017, I am a certified translator
          with over ten years of experience and top quality ratings. Drawing from a broad
          international background, I collaborate with Japanese and global organizations on
          translation and localization projects. With a passion for cross-cultural communication, I
          strive to facilitate interactions and promote growth in a variety of markets. <br /><br
          />I specialize in business and digital media, but I am also active in other fields
          including tourism, marketing, music, education and international cooperation. I use CAT
          tools such as Trados Studio and Phrase for optimal QA and terminology management. In line
          with the latest trends in this industry, my goal is to deliver high-quality content that
          not only meets clientsâ€™ needs but also provides impactful, satisfying experiences.
